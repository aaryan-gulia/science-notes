- Cross-chain interoperability is paramount for various DeFi applications (DEXs, DApps, etc). The technology must be trustless to prevent reliance on centralized intermediaries. Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) are commonly used for this purpose.
- A game theoretical framework can be established to construct a parametrized solution for the success rate of cross-chain swaps through HTLCs and Packetized Payments (PPs).
- Existing parameters lead to high failure rates of cross-chain swaps, and in the case of PPs can theoretically allow malicious agents to make profits. 
- The game theoretical framework can be extended to derive optimization solutions to increase the success rate of atomic swaps and PPs: 1. Collatralization 2. Adjustable Exchange Rates.

## Introduction
 `````{margin} **Atomic Swaps**
Atomic Swaps are direct and automatic peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges of crypto assets existing on fundamentally different blockchain networks without the use of centralized intermediaries {cite}'miraz2019atomic'

In the Decentralized Finance (Defi) landscape, interoperability between disparate blockchain networks is paramount to transmitting data and value across chains. Cross-chain technology is implemented across Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), cross-platform Decentralized Applications (DApps), tokenized real assets, distributed transaction platforms, etc. The technologies need to enable secure and trustless transactions to prevent reliance on centralized intermediaries. To this end, Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs), a form of atomic swaps, are commonly used to achieve cross-chain asset exchange. An alternative approach is Packetized Payments (PPs), which implement a series of alternating transactions to achieve cross-ledger exchange. In this article, we investigate the recent studies regarding these protocols - unraveling their execution success rate bottlenecks and exploring the proposed solutions.


### HLTCs
HTLCs are a type of smart contract, which uses elements on cryptocurrency on-chain transactions along with hash-lock and time-lock contracts to reduce counterparty risk in cross-chain asset exchange. A hash lock is a hashed or cryptographically scrambled version of the secret (key) generated by the agent initiating the swap and is used by both agents to lock their assets. The swap is complete when the initiating agent reveals the preimage of the hashlock to access the received assets, which enables the second agent to access their received assets. Further, if the HTLC contract is not completed within the pre-determined time constraint, both parties automatically receive their initial assets, and the swap fails. 

### PPs
Packetized Payments start by breaking down transactions into packets. Further, On each step, the participant would match the previous transfer and extend their transfer, hence ensuring equal distribution of counterparty risk. If any participant were to exit the transaction, the other agent would lose a maximum of one packet, which is sized to be economically insignificant.

## Game Theoretical Analysis
A game theoretical framework is developed to sequentially analyze events in the two protocols and derive probabilities for the success rate of cross-chain exchanges.
